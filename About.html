            <li>Chase Atlantic is an Australian alternative R&B band and production trio from Cairns, Queensland, formed in 2014.</li>
            <li> The Group consists of three members which are Christian Anthony, Clinton Cave and Mitchel Cave</li>
            <li>Chase Atlantic has a unique style of music, which, according to the band, is "conjured up dark alternative pop punctuated by rock and R&B." Throughout their four years of making music, their music style has changed from an alternative pop sound to a more alternative R&B sound. The music is a combination of R&B, rock, pop, and alternative and is influenced by many artists from those genres, including Tame Impala, the Weeknd, the 1975 and the Neighbourhood.</li>
